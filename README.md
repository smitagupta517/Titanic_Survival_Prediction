# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

The titanic survival problem is a binary classification problem to determine whether a person with given features survived in titanic disaster or not. The dataset contains the features to determine whether a person survived or not. The features in the dataset are:
1. Survival(target variable): 1 for person survived in titanic and 0 for person died in titanic.
2. PassengerId
3. Pclass: Ticket class
4. Name: Name of the passenger
5. Sex: Gender of the passenger
6. Age: Age of the passenger
7. SibSp: # Siblings/ Spouse with passengers
8. Parch: #Parents/ Children with passenger
9. Ticket: Ticket number
10. Fare: Passenger fare
11. Cabin: Cabin number
12. Embarked: Port of Embarkation

I have applied two classification algorithms: Logistic Regression and RandomTreeClassifier after pre-processing the dataset. Logistic regression gave 76% accuracy while RandomeForestClassifier gave 81% accuracy.
